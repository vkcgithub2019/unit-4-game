This is a crystal collection game app. At the start of the game, the computer will randomly assign a number and the player have to match this number by clicking on the 4 crystals to gather points. The points in each crystal is randomly assigned during each game and are hidden from the player. The assigned value of each crystal can only be revealed when the player clicks on it. If the total points gathered by clicking on the crystals match the given number,the player wins. If the total points gathered is over the given number the player lose. The game will then reset, new random number for the player generated and new hidden value assigned to each of the 4 crystals without refreshing the page. There will be a counter to track the wins and losses.
